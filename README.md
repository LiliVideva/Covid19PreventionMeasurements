# COVID-19 Prevention Measures

## Game Plan
 - Retrieve information from _Wikipedia_ regarding the pandemic in the different countries
 - Fetch statistics per country, describing the development of the disease in time (new cases, cured, active, deceased)
 - Extract from the data the applied measures by the governments  
 - Create a _timeline_ for the restrictions 
 - Discover the correlation between the applied measures and the development of the disease per country
